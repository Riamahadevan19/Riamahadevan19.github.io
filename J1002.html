1.1:
One of the other services that I use is emailing.
Another of the services that I use is printing.

2.1
I think that the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important because independent directories belonging to a single user should not be dependent upon another user, also users might become limited in terms of the number of names they can use for new directories.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I learned how to navigate emacs, write basic commands, how to make a directory, and create information in a new file.

What challenges did I encounter?
An initial challenge I encountered was figuring out how to navigate emacs 

How could this experience be improved?
This experience could emphasize more on how to make new directories and make tutorials more user friendly. 

Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
What I've learned today is a new skill which has affected my thinking positively.
